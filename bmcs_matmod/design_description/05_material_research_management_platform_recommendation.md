# Platform Recommendation for Workflow Management in Material Research

Further elaborate on a suitable tool - possible open-source and python based, which would provide the support for material research process with several workflows, i.e. processes focusing on the planning of experiments with predefined loads and obtained monitored data, calibration of the models - like those we implement here based on GSM framework, another example is a validation workflow which connects the calibrated model with another experiment and evaluates the quality of prediction. the testing, calibration and validation may be defined hierarchically to proceed from small scales - micro- to meso- and macro. Another workflow can be defined as upscaling, i.e. a transformation between a meso-scale to macro-scale model , or to the life-time scale. Finally a workflow can be considered as a material-design which changes proposes an alternative composition and curing processes for new types of materials. When you consider this vision, which type of implementation framework, or tool would come to your mind as a suitable platform?

## Vision Recap

The envisioned material research platform should support:
- **Experiment Planning:** Design and manage experimental campaigns with predefined loads and data acquisition.
- **Model Calibration:** Automate parameter fitting for GSM and other models using experimental data.
- **Validation:** Connect calibrated models to new experiments and assess predictive quality.
- **Hierarchical Workflows:** Enable workflows that span micro-, meso-, and macro-scales, including upscaling and downscaling.
- **Material Design:** Support workflows for proposing and evaluating new material compositions and processing routes.
- **Extensibility:** Allow new workflow types and integration with external tools (simulation, optimization, databases).
- **Provenance & Reproducibility:** Track all data, parameters, and workflow steps for transparency and repeatability.
- **Open Source & Python Ecosystem:** Prefer open, scriptable, and community-supported solutions.

## Platform Candidates

### 1. **AiiDA**
- **Strengths:** Provenance, persistence, Python API, plugin system, workflow branching, HPC integration.
- **Limitations:** Focused on computational science; less native support for experiment planning or direct lab integration.
- **Suitability:** Excellent for simulation, calibration, validation, and upscaling workflows; can be extended for experiment planning via plugins or external connectors.

### 2. **SimStack (Fraunhofer ITWM)**
- **Strengths:** Open-source, Python-based, workflow management for simulation and experiment, supports hierarchical workflows, integrates with databases and lab equipment.
- **Limitations:** Smaller community than AiiDA, less mature documentation.
- **Suitability:** Good for integrating experimental planning, simulation, and data management in a single platform.

### 3. **FireWorks**
- **Strengths:** Python-based, workflow management, supports complex DAGs, widely used in materials science (esp. atomistic simulations).
- **Limitations:** Less focus on provenance than AiiDA, less direct support for experiment/lab integration.
- **Suitability:** Good for simulation and upscaling workflows, can be extended for calibration/validation.

### 4. **Snakemake**
- **Strengths:** Pythonic, simple, scalable, supports DAGs, used in bioinformatics and data science.
- **Limitations:** File-based, less interactive, less focus on provenance.
- **Suitability:** Useful for reproducible pipelines, but less suited for interactive or experiment-driven workflows.

### 5. **KNIME / Orange**
- **Strengths:** Visual workflow editors, Python integration, data analytics, machine learning.
- **Limitations:** Not natively designed for simulation or experiment planning, less scriptable.
- **Suitability:** Good for data analysis and ML, but not for full research process management.

## Recommendation

### **AiiDA as the Core Platform**

Given the requirements, **AiiDA** stands out as the most suitable open-source, Python-based platform for the following reasons:

- **Provenance and Reproducibility:** Every workflow, calculation, and data object is tracked in a database, supporting full traceability.
- **Workflow Flexibility:** Supports complex, hierarchical, and branching workflows, including loops and parameter sweeps.
- **Extensibility:** New workflow types (e.g., experiment planning, upscaling, material design) can be implemented as plugins or WorkChains.
- **Integration:** Can be connected to external databases, lab equipment (via plugins), and other Python tools (e.g., for optimization, ML).
- **Community and Support:** Active development, good documentation, and a growing ecosystem in computational materials science.

#### **How to Address Experiment Planning and Lab Integration?**
- Use AiiDA's plugin system to create nodes that represent experimental steps, data acquisition, or lab automation.
- Integrate with ELNs (Electronic Lab Notebooks) or LIMS (Laboratory Information Management Systems) via REST APIs or Python connectors.
- Store experimental data as Data nodes, enabling seamless connection to calibration and validation workflows.

#### **Hierarchical and Multi-Scale Workflows**
- Define WorkChains for each scale (micro, meso, macro) and link them via upscaling/downscaling nodes.
- Use AiiDA's ability to pass data/results between WorkChains to implement hierarchical workflows.

#### **Material Design and Optimization**
- Integrate with Python-based optimization libraries (e.g., scikit-optimize, Optuna) or external tools.
- Use AiiDA to manage the workflow of proposing new compositions, running simulations/experiments, and evaluating results.

## Alternative/Complementary Tools

- **SimStack**: If tighter integration with lab equipment and experiment planning is required, SimStack can be used alongside AiiDA, with data exchange via files or APIs.
- **FireWorks**: For users already familiar with FireWorks, it can be used for simulation workflows, but provenance and experiment integration are less mature.
- **KNIME/Orange**: For advanced data analytics and ML, these tools can be used as postprocessing steps, with data exported from AiiDA.
