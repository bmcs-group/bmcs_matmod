    "### Visco-plasticity and Rheology\n",
    "\n",
    "Visco-plasticity refers to materials that exhibit both viscous and plastic behavior, which involves yield stress beyond which permanent deformation occurs and time-dependent deformation characteristics.\n",

    "\n",
    "**In summary**: The Kelvin-Voigt model is best suited for purely viscoelastic materials. To describe visco-plastic behavior, one needs to extend rheological models to include yield stress and plastic flow mechanisms, often through the combination of viscoelastic elements and yield/plasticity criteria."
