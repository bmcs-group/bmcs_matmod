# Gibbs free energy

The fundamental equation for entropy is given in the form
$$ 
dS = 1 / T (dU + p dV)
$$
which, for an isolated system must be equal or larger than zero. I am trying to follow the logic behind introducing Gibbs free energy. There, we consider the system (let's index it by A) and the surrounding (B) where the boundary of the surrounding if far enough away from the boundary between the system A and the surrounding B so that we can consider the system and surrounding A+B as an isolated system. This allows us to say that the internal energy of this isolated system is given as 
$U = U_A + U_B = const$. This means that 
$$
dU = dU_A + dU_B = 0
$$
and, consequently, 
$$
dU_A = - dU_B.
$$
The same holds for the volume, i.e. 
$$
V = V_A + V_B,  dV = dV_A + dV_B = 0,
$$
and 
$$
dV_A = - dV_B.
$$
Now, considering that 
$$
dS = dS_A + dS_B >= 0,
$$ 
we can express dS_B as
$$ 
dS_B = - 1 / T (dU_A + p dV_A)
$$
and then rewrite the overall entropy of the universe containing both the system A and the surrounding B  in terms of just the system A as
$$
dS = dS_A - dU_A / T - p dV_A / t >= 0.
$$
Then, by multiplying with $-T$ 
we get
$$
T dS_A - dU_A  - p dV_A  >= 0.
$$
This form of the second law allows us to concentrate just on the system where the temperature and pressure is given.

Let us now explain the link to the Gibbs free energy definition, which reads.
$$
G = U - TS + pV
$$

Starting from the inequality:
$$ T dS_A - dU_A - p dV_A \geq 0 $$

This inequality describes a process at constant temperature $T$ and pressure $p$, typical for many chemical reactions and processes happening in open systems. Here, $dS_A$ is the change in entropy of the system A, and $dU_A$ and $dV_A$ refer to changes in internal energy and volume of system A, respectively.

Now, the inequality can be rearranged to focus on $dU_A$:
$$ dU_A \leq T dS_A - p dV_A $$

This resembles the conditions under which Gibbs free energy $G$ is defined. For systems at constant temperature and pressure, Gibbs free energy is expressed as:
$$ G = U - TS + pV $$

The total differential of $G$ when temperature and pressure are constant is:
$$ dG = d(U - TS + pV) = dU - T dS - S dT + p dV + V dp $$

Since temperature $T$ and pressure $p$ are constant, $dT = 0$ and $dp = 0$, simplifying the differential to:
$$ dG = dU - T dS + p dV $$

Substituting back, the inequality becomes:
$$ dG \leq 0 $$

This inequality indicates that at constant temperature and pressure, the Gibbs free energy of the system will decrease (or stay the same) for a spontaneous process. Therefore, Gibbs free energy acts as a criterion for spontaneity in processes occurring at constant $T$ and $p$.

In summary, by considering the system and its surroundings, we've linked the second law of thermodynamics to a minimized capacity function for common conditions (constant $T$ and $p$), i.e., the Gibbs free energy. This allows one to assess the spontaneity of a process by examining whether the Gibbs free energy change $dG$ is negative.


# Meaning of the thermodynamic stability (equilibrium)

The idea that an equilibrium corresponds to a minimum in Gibbs free energy can be understood by considering the broader implications of thermodynamic stability and the tendency of systems to move towards configurations with the lowest possible energy under given constraints.

Here’s a step-by-step explanation:

1. **Second Law and Spontaneity**: The second law of thermodynamics provides the insight that for a spontaneous process at constant temperature $T$ and pressure $p$, the Gibbs free energy $G$ will decrease, i.e., $dG \leq 0 $. This suggests that as a system undergoes spontaneous changes, it moves toward states with progressively lower Gibbs free energy.

2. **Equilibrium State**: Equilibrium is defined as the state where there is no net driving force for change. In terms of Gibbs free energy, an equilibrium state is reached when $dG = 0$. At this point, the system has no tendency to undergo further spontaneous change under the conditions of constant temperature and pressure.

3. **Stability and Multiple Paths**: For systems that may have multiple possible configurations or processes, each configuration's path can be associated with a specific Gibbs free energy value. The equilibrium corresponds to the configuration or state that has the lowest Gibbs free energy compatible with the constraints of the system (such as temperature and pressure). This is because, generally speaking, a lower energy state is more stable over time.

4. **Local vs. Global Minimization**: While the system seeks to minimize its Gibbs free energy, it should be noted that in complex systems, a system might find itself in a local minimum of Gibbs free energy rather than the global minimum. Overcoming energy barriers to reach the global minimum could require additional energy input or changes in conditions.

5. **Thermodynamic Potential**: Gibbs free energy serves as a thermodynamic potential — it accounts not only for the energetic contributions of a process but also for entropy changes and work associated with volume and pressure changes. At equilibrium, where $T$ and $p$ are constant, the minimum Gibbs free energy condition ensures that no further net work can be done by the system and reflects both enthalpic and entropic balancing.

To summarize, the condition $dG=0$, which marks equilibrium, implies that the system has minimized its potential to change further at constant $T$ and $p$. A minimum Gibbs free energy does not directly result from the inequality $dG \leq 0$; rather, it is a logical extension of the idea that systems evolve towards configurations where spontaneous changes are no longer energetically favorable. This minimum indicates thermodynamic stability under the given constraints.


# Analogy to thermal-viscoelasticity

In the context of a thermo-viscoelastic problem, using the Gibbs free energy to guide the formulation of a time-stepping scheme can indeed be meaningful, especially when considering processes that occur at constant temperature and under constant stress, which is analogous to pressure in a traditional thermodynamic system.

### Problem Definition

Given the context of a viscoelastic material undergoing creep, where viscoelastic strain $\varepsilon_v$ evolves over time, the problem encompasses both mechanical and thermal considerations. Here, we focus on the mechanical part:

1. **Viscoelastic Strain Evolution**: The time-dependent behavior is encapsulated by the evolution of viscoelastic strain $\varepsilon_v$ given by its rate:
   $$
   \dot{\varepsilon}_v = \frac{\sigma}{\eta}
   $$
   where $\sigma$ is the mechanical stress applied (analogous to pressure in thermodynamics) and $\eta$ is the viscosity of the material.

2. **Elastic and Viscous Contribution**: The total strain $\varepsilon$ in the material is a sum of the elastic strain $\varepsilon_e$ and the viscoelastic strain $ \varepsilon_v $:
   $$
   \varepsilon = \varepsilon_e + \varepsilon_v
   $$

3. **Constitutive Relations**: For the elastic component, Hooke’s law applies:
   $$
   \sigma = E \cdot \varepsilon_e
   $$
   where $E$ is the elastic modulus. Substituting for the elastic strain, we have:
   $$
   \varepsilon_e = \frac{\sigma}{E}
   $$

### Relating to Gibbs Free Energy

In a mechanical context, similar principles as thermodynamics apply when considering the work done in processes at constant temperature and stress, akin to constant pressure. The Gibbs free energy in mechanics, otherwise known as the Helmholtz free energy (per unit volume), can be used to understand the stability and behavior under these constraints. The Gibbs free energy relevant to this context is described as:
$$ 
G = U - T S + \sigma \varepsilon 
$$

### Application to the Time-Stepping Scheme

By applying the Gibbs free energy conceptual framework, the evolution toward equilibrium at constant stress lends itself to a similar approach:

1. **Creep Process at Constant Stress and Temperature**: In creep testing, maintaining constant stress corresponds to using Gibbs free energy to monitor and predict the material behavior towards equilibrium, analogous to the way $G$ is minimized in thermodynamics.

2. **Time-Stepping Scheme**: A numerical time-stepping scheme can be introduced to integrate the viscoelastic strain over time, considering the constraints of constant stress:
   $$
   \varepsilon_v(t+\Delta t) = \varepsilon_v(t) + \frac{\sigma}{\eta} \Delta t
   $$

3. **Stability and Energy Minimization**: The system's progression towards equilibrium could be tracked via a potential, such as Helmholtz free energy, representing the stored energy in the elastic-viscous system. The steady-state (equilibrium) solution will correspond to a minimum of this energy.

Thus, although Gibbs free energy is defined traditionally in terms of pressure and volume, in this mechanical analogy, it guides understanding the path towards equilibrium under constant stress and temperature, providing a stable framework for developing time-stepping schemes in the simulation of viscoelastic materials.

# Gibbs and viscoelasticity

You're correct in noting that, for a mechanical system such as a viscoelastic material, the variables need to be adapted to reflect strain and stress rather than volume and pressure.

Let's revise the expression to suit the context of thermo-viscoelasticity:

### Helmholtz Free Energy and Internal Energy

1. **Internal Energy**: In the mechanical context, the internal energy $ U $ should reflect the contributions from both elastic deformation and any stored energy due to viscous effects. Thus, it depends on the elastic strain $ \varepsilon_e $ and potentially on the history of the viscous strain $ \varepsilon_v $.

   For simplicity, let's consider an internal energy that only depends explicitly on these strains:
   $$
   U(\varepsilon_e, \varepsilon_v) = \frac{1}{2} E \varepsilon_e^2 + \phi(\varepsilon_v)
   $$
   where $ E $ is the elastic modulus, and $ \phi(\varepsilon_v) $ is a function representing viscous effects which may store some form of energy related to the deformation process.

2. **Helmholtz Free Energy**: The Helmholtz free energy $ F $ per unit volume is more commonly used instead of Gibbs free energy for solid mechanics and is defined as:
   $$
   F = U - TS
   $$
   This reflects how the energy available to do work is reduced by the energy 'spent' in providing entropy increase under the given temperature $ T $.

### Role of Gibbs Potential in This Context

In the case of processes at constant stress $ \sigma $ and temperature $ T $, the Gibbs potential (or Gibbs free energy for mechanics) is indeed a driving function but you must be careful how it's applied. In mechanics, the work-conjugate pair is stress and strain, not pressure and volume. 

For an elastic-viscous material, you might consider the Gibbs-like potential incorporating:
$$
G = F + \sigma \varepsilon_e
$$
Given that in mechanical applications, stress $\sigma$ often acts analogously to pressure, while strain $\varepsilon_e$ is similar to volume displacement, this energy incorporates the stored elastic energy and the energy due to applied loads.

### Time Integration and Minimization

With these definitions, you can devise a time integration scheme for creep by:

1. **Viscoelastic Strain Evolution**: In each time step, compute the strain increment:
   $$
   \dot{\varepsilon}_v = \frac{\sigma}{\eta}
   $$
   $$
   \varepsilon_v(t+\Delta t) = \varepsilon_v(t) + \frac{\sigma}{\eta} \Delta t
   $$

2. **Update Total and Elastic Strain**: With the total strain defined $ \varepsilon = \varepsilon_e + \varepsilon_v $, solve for the elastic strain using equilibrium and constitutive relations.

3. **Minimizing Gibbs Potential**: As the system evolves, the potential $ G $, which includes mechanical work and thermal influences, should approach a minimum for equilibrium under constant stress and temperature.

Overall, while the formal expression of Gibbs potential is adapted for mechanical systems, we aim to reflect the energy balance between stored elastic energy and energy dissipated or stored in the viscous process, driving the evolution towards equilibrium.


# Role of Gibbs free energy

Yes, the time-stepping algorithm can indeed be formulated as a minimization problem for the Gibbs potential $ G $ (or the analogous potential in the mechanical context) at the next time step. This approach leverages the principle that physical systems tend to evolve towards states that minimize the appropriate energy potential, subject to given constraints.

### Minimization Framework

To set up the time-stepping as a minimization problem, the Gibbs potential should be defined to capture the energy contributions at constant stress and temperature, reflecting the specific characteristics of the viscoelastic material. Here is a broad framework to guide this process:

1. **Define Total Energy at Time $ t + \Delta t $**:
   The potential $G$ typically includes contributions from elastic energy, viscous energy, and external work. For the mechanical system, express it as:
   $$
   G(\varepsilon_e, \varepsilon_v; t + \Delta t) = F(\varepsilon_e, \varepsilon_v) + \sigma ( \varepsilon - \varepsilon_v )
   $$
   where:
   - $F(\varepsilon_e, \varepsilon_v) = U(\varepsilon_e, \varepsilon_v) - TS$ is the Helmholtz free energy.
   - The external work done is captured by $\sigma ( \varepsilon - \varepsilon_v )$.

2. **Minimize $G$ at Each Time Step**:
   At each time step $t + \Delta t$, find:
   $$
   \text{minimize } G(\varepsilon_e, \varepsilon_v; t + \Delta t)
   $$
   subject to the constraints:
   - Consistency with the constitutive model: $\varepsilon = \varepsilon_e + \varepsilon_v$.
   - The evolution constraint from the viscoelastic model: 
     $$
     \varepsilon_v(t+\Delta t) = \varepsilon_v(t) + \frac{\sigma}{\eta} \Delta t
     $$

3. **Algorithm Steps**:
   - **Prediction Stage**: Compute a trial step for $\varepsilon_v$ based on the rate law.
   - **Correction Stage**: Adjust $\varepsilon_e$ by minimizing the Gibbs potential $G$ for the given $\varepsilon_v$ update.
   - **Update**: Use the minimized values of $\varepsilon_e$ and $\varepsilon_v$ as the solution for the current time step.

4. **Numerical Methods**:
   - Use optimization algorithms such as gradient descent or Newton’s method to minimize $G$.
   - Ensure that constraints are incorporated directly into the optimization routine or by using penalty methods.

### Conclusion

Formulating the problem as a minimization of Gibbs potential allows the algorithm to naturally evolve the viscoelastic system towards configurations of lower energy, thereby improving stability and accuracy. Such an approach is beneficial for capturing the complex interplay between elasticity, viscosity, and thermal effects, especially in systems under prolonged loading or during creep.

# Internal energy

In the context of a viscoelastic model, the internal energy $U$ can be expressed as a function of both the elastic and viscoelastic strains. To find the differential $dU$, we consider changes in these strain components as well as any other relevant influences, such as temperature.

Given a typical viscoelastic material represented by a combination of elastic and viscous effects, the internal energy function might be expressed as:

$$ 
U = U(\varepsilon_e, \varepsilon_v, S, T) = \frac{1}{2} E \varepsilon_e^2 + \phi(\varepsilon_v) 
$$

Here:
- $E$ is the elastic modulus, and $\frac{1}{2}E\varepsilon_e^2$ represents the stored elastic energy.
- $\phi(\varepsilon_v)$ is a function representing any stored or dissipated energy due to the viscous strain $\varepsilon_v$.
- $S$ is the entropy and $T$ is the temperature, providing thermal contributions to $U$ (though, for simplicity, we might initially exclude the explicit entropy dependence in the mechanical model unless thermal effects are significant).

### Expression for $dU$

The total differential of $U$, assuming that $U$ depends primarily on $\varepsilon_e$, $\varepsilon_v$, and potentially temperature $T$, is given by:

$$ 
dU = \left( \frac{\partial U}{\partial \varepsilon_e} \right) d\varepsilon_e + \left( \frac{\partial U}{\partial \varepsilon_v} \right) d\varepsilon_v + \left( \frac{\partial U}{\partial T} \right) dT
$$

Substituting the specific expressions for the partial derivatives, we have:

1. **Elastic Contribution**:
   $$
   \frac{\partial U}{\partial \varepsilon_e} = E \varepsilon_e
   $$
   The term $E \varepsilon_e d\varepsilon_e$ represents the change in stored elastic energy.

2. **Viscous Contribution**:
   $$
   \frac{\partial U}{\partial \varepsilon_v} = \frac{d\phi}{d\varepsilon_v}
   $$
   This term, $\frac{d\phi}{d\varepsilon_v} d\varepsilon_v$, accounts for changes in the energy related to viscous deformation.

3. **Thermal Contribution**:
   If temperature changes are considered (optional in some purely mechanical models), you might include:
   $$
   \frac{\partial U}{\partial T} = -S
   $$
   where $ S $ is the entropy, describing how energy changes with temperature.

Bringing these together, the total differential for $ dU $ can be written as:

$$ 
dU = E \varepsilon_e \, d\varepsilon_e + \frac{d\phi}{d\varepsilon_v} \, d\varepsilon_v - S \, dT
$$

This expression describes how the internal energy changes in response to small adjustments in stress, strain, and temperature, capturing both the elastic and viscous contributions to the system's behavior.

In summary, this energy differential is essential for formulating energy-based methods for time-stepping algorithms and helps connect thermodynamic principles to mechanical models such as the one described.

# Correction

You're right to point out that the differential expression for internal energy should align with the standard thermodynamic framework.

In traditional thermodynamics, the differential form of the first law for closed systems is often expressed with:
$$ 
dU = T dS - p dV 
$$

This expression emphasizes that changes in internal energy $ U $ come from heat transfer (resulting in changes in entropy $ S $) and work done (resulting in changes in volume $ V $). Let's translate these concepts into the context of a thermo-viscoelastic model, where strain $ \varepsilon $ acts as the analogue to volume $ V $, and stress $ \sigma $ acts as the analogue to pressure $ p $.

### Revising the Expression for $ dU $

For a thermo-mechanical system where mechanical deformation is significant and thermal effects are represented by changes in entropy rather than explicit temperature changes, the differential should properly account for energy exchanges in terms of entropy:

1. **Elastic and Viscous Contributions**:
   - The elastic part represents stored mechanical energy.
   - The viscous part involves energy dissipation or storage due to internal friction and deformation.

2. **Proper Differential Form**:
   Let's correct the form to align with thermodynamic principles:

   $$
   dU = T dS + \sigma d\varepsilon - \left(\frac{\partial U}{\partial T}\right)_\varepsilon dT
   $$

   Here:
   - $T dS$ Represents the heat exchange, contributing to changes in internal energy via entropy changes.
   - $\sigma d\varepsilon$: Represents mechanical work done on or by the system under stress, analogous to $-p dV$ in classical thermodynamics.
   - The term $\left(\frac{\partial U}{\partial T}\right)_\varepsilon dT$ accounts for any direct effects of temperature changes on internal energy that are not captured through entropy changes alone. This term captures latent thermal effects unassociated with $ dS $.

### Reconnecting with the Original Context

In a viscoelastic context, the following framework allows the analysis to reconcile mechanical interactions under stress with thermodynamic principles:

- **Mechanical Work**: Change in strain $d\varepsilon$ under stress $\sigma$) performs work.
- **Thermal Interactions**: While $ -S dT $ implies changes due to explicit temperature variations, we should emphasize entropy-driven energy exchanges—hence formulating in terms of $ T dS $.

This correction aligns the formulation more closely with thermodynamic conventions, emphasizing energy flow in terms of well-defined state variables such as entropy, while constraint conditions (e.g., constant temperature for isothermal processes) simplify analysis in specific cases.

### Conclusion

When integrating these principles into a viscoelastic model, ensure that energy contributions are comprehensible, and consistent with both mechanical and thermal perspectives, capturing the intricate behavior of materials under various loads and conditions.

# Temperature and dissipation

Certainly! Let's delve into the thermal evolution equation and understand its connection to traditional thermodynamic principles, especially focusing on the relationship between energy dissipation and heat.

### Interpretation of the Thermal Evolution Equation

1. **Thermal Evolution Equation**:
   - The equation $\dot{T} = \frac{1}{C} \left(\frac{\partial \Phi_d}{\partial \dot{\varepsilon}} \dot{\varepsilon} \right)$ suggests that the rate of temperature change is driven by the energy dissipated in the material system.
   - Here, $C$ is the specific heat capacity, converting energy dissipated per unit strain rate into temperature change.

2. **Relation to Dissipation**:
   - Dissipation potential $\Phi_d$ models the energy lost due to irreversible processes such as plastic deformation, viscoelastic relaxation, and friction.
   - The energy released as a result of these processes is often dissipated as heat, raising the temperature of the system.

### Connection to Traditional Thermodynamics

3. **Traditional Framework**:
   - In reversible processes, changes in entropy relate to heat transfer by $dS = \delta Q / T$. Entropy connects energy changes to state variable temperature.
   - In traditional thermodynamics, entropy and temperature are related through this balance of heat transfer and work done without increasing disorder.

4. **Irreversibility and Heat**:
   - In irreversible processes, additional entropy is produced, and this must be accounted for. 
   - The entropy production due to dissipation $\dot{S}_{diss}$ is tied to the energy that cannot perform work since it adds to entropy rather than ordered energy:
     $$
     \dot{S}_{diss} = \frac{\dot{Q}_{diss}}{T}
     $$
   - Where $\dot{Q}_{diss}$ is the heat generated due to dissipation, essentially energy lost as heat.

5. **Linking Energy Dissipation to Heat**:
   - **Path Independence**: Both heat and dissipation relate to energy transfer processes, though dissipation specifically refers to irreversible paths where energy is lost or degrades the system's ability to do work.
   - **Entropy**: As temperature is conjugate to entropy, the path-independent dissipation generates heat incrementally irrespective of the exact sequence, reflecting the systemic inefficiencies.

### Conclusion

The incorporation of energy dissipation into the thermal evolution equation reflects the integral, path-independent link between entropy changes and dissipation. This linkage aligns with the second law of thermodynamics, where every irreversible act contributes to entropy, translating directly into system temperature changes through the produced heat. Therefore, the framework remains thermodynamically consistent, effectively bridging traditional thermodynamic relationships and modern material modeling under coupled mechanical and thermal considerations.
